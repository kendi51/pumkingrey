                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These terms and conditions (together with the information and policies contained in the "Customer Service" pages on the website and any other documents referred in these terms and conditions) ("Terms and Conditions") set out the legal terms that apply to your use of our website http://www.PumkinGrey.com, any of its sub-domains and any other websites operated by us or on our behalf and any mobile device application or desktop application developed by us or on our behalf (together, the "Websites" and “Website” being a reference to any one of them) and the other services that we provide (the "Services").
                        <br>
                        Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully and make sure that you understand them before using the Services. Please note that by using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not accept these Terms and Conditions, you will not be able to use the Services and you should leave the Website immediately. If you continue to use the Website or if you order products, we will take this as your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1) Understanding these Terms and Conditions
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms and Conditions, they have specific meanings (these are known as 'defined terms'). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of the Terms and Conditions where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).
                        <br>
                        When we refer to "PumkinGrey", "we", "us" or "our", we mean PumkinGrey Limited or, where relevant, its affiliates. Where we refer to "you" or "your" we mean you, the person using the Services.
                        <br>
                        We have used headings to help you understand these Terms and Conditions and to easily locate information. These Terms and Conditions are only available in the English language. We will not file copies of the contracts between us and you relating to our supply of the Services, or between you and the Partners relating to the sale of the products, so we recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms and Conditions for your records (but please note that we may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time so please check the Website regularly, and each time you use the Services to order products, to ensure you understand the legal terms which apply at that time).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2) About us
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        IMPORTANT: If you are purchasing products from any of the brands or boutiques listed at the end of section 20 below (“Selected Partners”), then additional or different terms may apply to you in this section. Please see section 20 below.
                        <br>
                        We are PumkinGrey Limited and, along with certain of our affiliates, we operate the Website. PumkinGrey Limited is a company registered in England and Wales and our registered office is at D 103b Nongalwana Crescent, Ikwezi Park, Cape Town, 7784. Our registered company number is K2022890683 and our VAT number is 995 818 4187.
                        <br>
                        We, along with certain of our affiliates, provide the Services to you through the Website. Further details of the Services we provide are set out in section 3 below. When you purchase products using the Website, you are purchasing them from the third party retailers ("Partner(s)") named on the Website. It is important that you understand that the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. We are acting as agent on behalf of the Partners, which are the principals. You are not purchasing the products from us. We are authorized by the relevant Partners to conclude the contract on their behalf but we are not a party to that contract and you are not purchasing the products from us. Further details about the products, the Partners and the contract between you and the Partners in relation to your purchase of the products are set out in sections 5, 6 and 7 below.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3) Our services
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Services we offer allow you to search through the Website and purchase products from a large number of Partner boutiques and brands worldwide. As part of the Services, we also provide some ancillary services such as arranging delivery of the products, providing you with customer service assistance and payment processing without charge. The specific PumkinGrey entity procuring such payment processing services will depend on your location. If you are located in the USA then PumkinGrey.com US LLC will procure the payment processing services; if you are located anywhere else in the world, PumkinGrey Limited or one of its affiliates will procure the payment processing services. Similarly, PumkinGrey.com US LLC manages and runs the Website platform and provides the Services in respect of sales made to customers in the US; whereas PumkinGrey Limited or one of its affiliates manages and runs the Website platform and provides the Services for sales made to customers outside of the US. However, as stated above, the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. This means that it is the Partner (not us) who is legally responsible for selling the products to you.
                        <br>
                        Please note that the delivery logistics service is being provided by us to you and as such you are entering into a contract for delivery services provided by us. We may make a charge for these services which will be shown at checkout and prior to your purchase of the products. Your contract with us is concluded once the products have been delivered to you by the courier or have been collected by you from a Partner.
                        <br>
                        In order to use the Services you must be over 18 years of age.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4) Our liability to you in relation to the Services
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If, in providing the Services to you, we fail to comply with these Terms and Conditions, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms and Conditions or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time you started using the Services.
                        <br>
                        We do not in any way exclude or limit our liability for: • (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; • (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; • (c) any other liability which cannot be limited by law.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We attempt to be as accurate as possible in the description of the products displayed on the Website. However, as the descriptions are based on information provided to us by the Partners (who remain responsible for them), we cannot guarantee that all details are always accurate, complete or error free. Please contact our Customer Service Advisors if you would like more information about a product. The images of the products on the Website are for illustrative purposes only, and although we attempt to display colors accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of the images accurately reflect the true color of the products.
                        <br>
                        We do not allow partners to offer flawed items or products of lower quality than the corresponding market standards for sale on the website. If an item you have ordered is not as described, is flawed or of a lower quality, you can return it to us and we will liaise with the partner to process the return. Once the item is received by the relevant partner, you will receive a full refund of the defective item, or alternatively a discount, replacement or repair for the item where possible, decided by us on a case by case basis. We will refund you any applicable delivery charges and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the products (we will advise you whether the products will be collected from you or whether you need to arrange for them to be returned). Please see section 10 below for details of how to arrange a return.
                        <br>
                        As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to products that are faulty or not as described. Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions will affect these legal rights.
                        <br>
                        The products sold by the Partners are supplied for your domestic and private use only. You agree that you will not use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purposes. You further agree that you will not export, reexport, or otherwise transfer the products to countries or territories that are the target of comprehensive embargoes or sanctions or to parties identified on the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or the E.U.’s Consolidated Financial Sanctions List. Neither we nor the Partners have any liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, interruption of business or loss of business opportunity.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        IMPORTANT: If you are purchasing products from any of the brands or boutiques listed at the end of section 20 below (“Selected Partners”), then additional or different terms may apply to you in this section. Please see section 20 below.
                        <br>
                        As explained above, the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. We are acting as agent and are authorized by the relevant Partner to conclude the contract on its behalf but we are not a party to that contract and you are not purchasing the products directly from us.
                        <br>
                        If you are using cryptocurrency to pay for your order, when placing your order, you will be redirected to our cryptocurrency payment partner, TripleA, to complete your purchase. Your payment to TripleA shall be in full discharge of your payment obligation in respect of your purchase from PumkinGrey.
                        <br>
                        We request that all Partners using the Website have and maintain reasonable business policies which comply with our own business policies. We cannot, however, be responsible for the Partners’ business policies. If you are unhappy with the product or service you have received from a Partner, you should contact us and we will liaise with the relevant Partner on your behalf to try and resolve the issue.
                        <br>
                        Further information about the Partners and the products they offer is available in our How to Shop page.

                        7) Orders, prices, payment and taxes
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        IMPORTANT: If you are purchasing products from any of the brands or boutiques listed at the end of section 20 below (“Selected Partners”), then additional or different terms may apply to you in this section. Please see section 20 below.
                        <br>
                        The steps you need to take to place an order are explained in the "How to Order & Pay" section of our How to Shop page.
                        <br>
                        By completing the checkout process and placing an order by clicking the "Place Order" button on the checkout page, you are offering to purchase the products from the relevant Partner (and not directly from us). Your order for the products is subject to these Terms and Conditions which are incorporated into the contract between you and the relevant Partner. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price, which is determined by the relevant Partner. After entering into the contract for the products with the Partner, the Partner will be under a legal duty to supply you with goods that are in conformity with the contract. Legal title to the product purchased will pass to you upon your payment being accepted. Risk in the product will remain with the Partner and/or PumkinGrey (as applicable) until it is delivered to you at the address specified when you placed your order.
                        <br>
                        To order products you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid method of payment (please see section (c) below for details of acceptable payment methods). By placing an order, you are promising that all details you provide are true and accurate, that you are over 18 years of age, that you are authorized to use your selected method of payment to place your order and that there are sufficient funds in the relevant account to cover the cost of your order.
                        <br>
                        The Website allows you to check your order and correct any errors before completing a purchase. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process as you are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate (for example, the correct products, quantities, size, color, etc.).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        (a) Formation of the contract between you and the Partner(s). The identity of the Partner is shown on the order confirmation page when you place an order.
                        <br>
                        When you place an order, you will receive an email confirming receipt of your order. This email is only an acknowledgement for information purposes and it does not constitute acceptance of your order by the Partner. The contract between you and the Partner in relation to the products will not be formed until we have checked that the Partner accepts your order. If your order is accepted, we will send you a confirmation email, which concludes the contract between you and the Partner. The confirmation email will include a description of the products purchased in the order and certain other information about your rights to cancel the contract between you and the Partner (please see section 10 below for further information on your rights to cancel the contract). Only those products listed in the dispatch confirmation email are included in the contract between you and the Partner.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        (b) Pricing, availability and taxes
                        <br>
                        Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices that appear on the Website are accurate, as this information is provided to us by the Partners, there may be cases where errors occur. If we discover an error in the price of any products that you have ordered, we will inform you of this as soon as possible and, acting on behalf of the Partner, give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, your order will be treated as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the products, you will receive a full refund as soon as possible.
                        <br>
                        If you are viewing the Website from the UK or a country in the EU, the product prices advertised on the Website from Partners located within the EU are inclusive of the VAT charged by the relevant Partner. Delivery costs are not included in the prices and will be charged in addition. The delivery costs (which will include VAT charged by us) will vary depending on the products that you have ordered and your delivery address. Please see the "Shipping Information" section of our Orders and Shipping page for further details. The delivery costs applicable to your order will be clearly displayed at checkout before you place your order (and are included in the "Total Cost" amount shown on the order summary page).
                        <br>
                        Depending on your delivery address, different taxation rules and additional charges may apply. If you are shipping items from a Partner outside of your territory, you may need to pay import duties upon receipt of the products. We will notify you during the checkout process if import duties are included or you may have to pay them upon receipt of the products. If they are not included, neither we nor the Partner have any control over these charges and we cannot advise on their amount. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes that are not included. Please contact your local customs office for further information and a “landed cost estimate” before placing your order. Additional information is also available in the "Duties and Taxes" section of our Orders and Shipping page.
                        <br>
                        For US customers, PumkinGrey.com US LLC may charge and collect applicable sales or use taxes on purchases made through the Website. Even if sales or use tax is collected, your purchase may be subject to sales or use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Many states require customers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. For more details, please contact your respective taxing authorities.
                        <br>
                        Please note that if you return an item, the taxes and import duties will be refunded to you if they were originally included in the purchase price. By initiating a return, you agree to disclaim and assign exclusively to PumkinGrey (and to the exclusion of any other party), any right to or interest in duty drawback you may have with respect to the returned item.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        8) Delivery
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The estimated delivery date of the products will be stated in your order confirmation email. If you do not receive an estimated delivery date from us, we will deliver the order within 30 days after the date of dispatch. We (and not the Partners) supply delivery services to you and we will try to ensure that your order is delivered by the estimated delivery date if given,) but there may be circumstances where delivery is delayed because of events beyond our reasonable control (please see section 15 below for further information). If this happens, we will try and arrange for your products to be delivered as soon as possible, but we will not be liable to you for any losses caused as a result of such delay.
                        <br>
                        Delivery times may vary depending on the availability of the products and your delivery address. Delivery times, including for Same Day delivery, are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. The product(s) will be delivered to you directly by the Partner(s) so your order may arrive in multiple deliveries and at different times.
                        <br>
                        In certain circumstances our delivery partner may leave your package outside or provide you with optional services when delivering your order, such as: 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        (a) signature release: opting out of the requirement to provide a signature on delivery; 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        (b) leave with neighbour, reception or security: re-directing the delivery to a neighbour, reception or security; 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        (c) reschedule a new delivery date: selecting a delivery date that best suits you;

                        14) Ethical sourcing policy
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a reputable and trusted business committed to offering its customers high quality products, we recognise our obligation to ensure that all Partners and other suppliers are operating ethically. We expect all Partners and other suppliers to consistently provide an environment which protects their employees' health and safety and basic human rights. All Partners and other suppliers are expected to comply with their national employment laws and regulations with particular regard to: minimum age of employment, freely chosen employment, health and safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, no discrimination, no harsh or inhumane treatment, working hours, rates of pay and terms of employment.
                        <br>
                        We will never knowingly allow a Partner to offer its products on the Website if such products are sourced from countries which are in breach of these principles. We also look to the Partners and other suppliers to instil these principles when dealing with their own supplier base. Because of the sometimes complex nature of the Partners and other suppliers' supply chain, it is not always possible to monitor and control the conditions of each individual involved in the production of the products. However, as we continue to grow, we recognise the importance of being proactive and doing everything within our power to support the rights of those involved in the manufacture of the products.
                        <br>
                        In order to address the changing needs of our customers, products made from fur or endangered species are no longer available on the PumkinGrey Website. Fur products are defined as products made entirely from furs or made with fur trims. (In addition, from April 2022, we will no longer sell or market products made from or containing angora fur). We also require all exotic skin products listed to have CITES certification and will not allow the listing of exotic skin unless permitted according to CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

                        15) Kidswear policy
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The PumkinGrey Kidswear product safety policy sets out guidelines to highlight the types of products that Partners might be restricted to sell via the PumkinGrey platform due to product safety restrictions. Our policy states that Partners should seek regular independent advice and assurances from the brand/manufacturer/importer from whom the product is purchased to determine whether the goods are permitted to be sold into the country and where applicable, the state, in which the buyer is located. While we work closely with our Partners, it is our Partner’s responsibility to ensure that the goods they sell comply with all applicable product laws and regulations, such as Flammability Standards, Certificates of Compliance and Tracking Labels. Our Customer Service Advisors can liaise with the relevant Partner if you require additional information.

If either us or you brings any action or proceeding by reason of any breach or alleged breach of the other party hereunder, the party prevailing in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover its reasonable expenses in connection therewith (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) to the extent allowed under the law, from the other party. The term ‘prevailing party’ means the party obtaining substantially the relief sought, whether by compromise, settlement, or judgment.
                        <br>
                        The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms and Conditions. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of these Terms and Conditions as a court would.
                        <br>
                        If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuses of intellectual property rights.

The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. If either us or you brings any action or proceeding by reason of any breach or alleged breach of the other party hereunder, the party prevailing in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover its reasonable expenses in connection therewith (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) to the extent allowed under the law, from the other party.

Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights and that can include asking a set of security questions to ensure it is you. When you have appointed someone else to do the request on your behalf, that person and/or organisation needs to show a valid power of attorney issued by you. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To exercise any of your rights, please fulfil this Data Subject Request Form.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • Access: you have the right to know whether we process personal data about you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with (including the categories of personal data we share with businesses for their direct marketing uses and the names and addresses of those businesses). Please note that in your PumkinGrey account dashboard, you can see information about you, namely your account details (such as name, email, phone number, date of birth, the addresses you use for billing and shipping, your order history and shopping preferences).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can also request a copy of your information. If you require more than one copy of the data we hold about you, we may charge a reasonable administration fee.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We may not provide you with certain personal data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person) or where another exemption applies.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • Portability: you have the right to receive a subset of the personal data we collect from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such personal data to another party. The relevant subset of personal data is data that you provide us with your consent or for the purposes of performing our contract with you. If you wish for us to transfer the personal data to another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the personal data or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • Correction: you have the right to correct any personal data held about you that is inaccurate. You can edit your personal information in “My Account” settings. You can also request the correction by emailing us. Please note that in some cases we can ask you to explain in detail why you believe the personal data we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required. Please note that whilst we assess whether the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the applicable data as described below.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • Erasure: you may request that we erase the personal data we hold about you in certain circumstances. Please scroll down to know what those are:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o You believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold the personal data we hold about you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o We are processing the personal data we hold about you on the basis of your consent, and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no other ground under which we can process the personal data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o We are processing the personal data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is an overriding interest for us to retain such personal data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o You no longer wish us to use the personal data we hold about you in order to send you promotions and special offers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o You believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the data whilst we consider your request as described below. Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. Please note that we may retain the personal data if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (eg. for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Where you have requested that we erase data that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the data or providing links to the data to erase the data too.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • Restriction of Processing to Storage Only. You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note that if we stop processing the personal data, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (eg. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Listed below are the cases where you may request we stop processing and only store the personal data we hold about you: o You believe the personal data is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify your claim.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o You wish to erase the personal data as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to retain the personal data for storage only and stop processing it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o We wish to erase the personal data as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o You have objected to us processing personal data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal data whilst we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • Objection: at any time you have the right to object to our processing of data about you in order to send you promotions and special offers, including where we build profiles for such purposes and we will stop processing the data for that purpose. You can do this by changing your marketing preferences in your PumkinGrey account, selecting 'unsubscribe' at the bottom of our marketing emails or by completing the Unsubscribe Form. Please note that you will still receive emails related to the orders you make through our website or updates to our Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You also have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        o We are processing the data we hold about you (including where the processing is profiling) on the basis of our or a third party’s legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in us continuing to process such data or if we need to process it in relation to legal claims. Also note that you may exercise your right to request that we stop processing the data whilst we make the assessment on an overriding interest.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                                It's down to our unique business model. At PumkinGrey, you're shopping items from our luxury brands and partner boutiques worldwide.

                                Prices are determined by each PumkinGrey brand and partner boutique, so the price of the same item may vary depending on where it's coming from and your location. That's also why placing an item in your shopping bag or wishlist won't reserve it at a particular price.
